This Project is about automating web data gathering using python on Google Colab.
The task involved structured data from a live website. Three libraries were used:
Requests for handling HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, and pandas for storing and manipulating data
Data was collected and organized into a DataFrame, and export results to a .csv file.
