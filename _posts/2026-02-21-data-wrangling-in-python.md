This Project is about about data wrangling in python using Netflix Data.
The task involved loading the Netflix dataset from a CSV file and explore its structure using pandas:
Performing data discovery to assess data types, missing values, and quality issues
Cleaning the dataset by handling duplicates, missing values, and formatting inconsistencies
Transforming and enriching the dataset using techniques like filtering, sorting, grouping, and feature extraction.
Validating the final dataset by checking consistency, completeness, and logical accuracy.
Exporting the final cleaned dataset to a .csv file ready for analysis or visualization
